<strong>Usage</strong>

A user can log in if they already have an account or create a new account if they have not yet done so.  The user can also update their account (:name, :email, and/or :position) or delete their account entirely.  If signed in as an admin, the user can create teams, team members, projects, and tasks (and perform full CRUD actions on each item in this list), as well as assign team members to teams, projects to teams, tasks to projects, and tasks to specific team members.  If any of these items have been created previously, the admin can view all exisiting objects from their main page. A user can also 'complete' a task or project, which marks it as 'done' on the project page or main page, respectively.
