# Group Agreement

* **Working Hours** <br>
Brandon: not available before 9:00 AM; could work most evenings after class until 12:00 AM; weekends if agreed upon beforehand <br>
Ronak:

* **Github Workflow** <br>
Are you working on branches? // Both on personal branches off of master.

* **Making Pull Requests** <br>
When is it ok to merge to master? // Let's both review before merging major changes.

* **Communication** <br>
Slack.  Trello for feature documentation.

* **Working Environment** <br>
Frequent check-ins with each other to make sure we're on the same page.  Daily stand-down right after class for evening strategy.  Active listening, mindfulness, and respect are paramount so that we both feel comfortable voicing our opinions and ideas.

* **Conflict Resolution** <br>
If anything comes up, we'll first talk about it respectfully (hopefully resolved here), then ask for another student project group opinion, then escalate to an instructor.  If not brought up before, issues can be discussed at daily stand-down and tabled if unable to come to an agreement.  Will seek instructor/coach opinion at that point, and their opinion will be the tie-breaker.

* **Other Notes** <br>
Our goals are to have fun implementing what we've learned and to learn even more as we create our project! <br>
